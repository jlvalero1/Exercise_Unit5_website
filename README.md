This is my first Git exercise, creating a simple website.
It would include an "Initial webpage file" in an "index.html" file.
Then I would add and upload an image to it using GitKraken.
I would add a new local branch called "about" to use as a footer with contact information.
Then I would merge that branch into the main branch using the command line.
Finally I'd create a new branch called "home" to add information to the website body.
After that I'd generate a conflict in the main branch and then solve it.
